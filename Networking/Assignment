Assignment: Deploy a web server on AWS EC2, configure NGINX to serve a webpage, and make the site accessible through a custom domain using DNS.


1. Launch EC2 instance 
- Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS

- Selected an appropriate instance type (free-tier eligible)

- Created and downloaded an SSH key pair (.pem)

- Configured the Security Group to allow:
   SSH (port 22)
   HTTP (port 80)

2. Connected to the instance via SSH
- Used Ubuntu (WSL) on Windows

- Moved the key pair into a secure location and set correct permissions

- Connected to the EC2 instance using SSH
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS>
This provided secure remote access to the server.

3. Installed and configured NGINX
- Updated system packages
  sudo apt update

- Installed NGINX as the web server
  sudo apt install nginx -y

- Started and enabled the NGINX service
  sudo systemct1 start nginx

- Verified NGINX was running locally
  curl http://localhost

4. Verified public access
- Accessed the site using the EC2 public IPv4 address
  http://<PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS>
Confirmed the NGINX welcome page loaded successfully

5. Configured DNS with Cloudflare
- Purchased a custom domain via Cloudflare

- Created DNS A records pointing the domain to the EC2 public IP
  Type: A
  Name: @
  Value: EC2 Public IPv4
  Proxy: DNS only
Waited for DNS propagation

6. Accessed the Site via Custom Domain
- Verified the site loaded successfully
  http://mydomainname.co.uk

- This confirmed:
  DNS resolution worked
  The domain correctly mapped to the EC2 instance
  NGINX served the page over the custom domain

7. Verified DNS resolution
- After creating the DNS A record, DNS resolution was verified using ping
  ping mydomainname.co.uk
