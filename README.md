### Hardest challenges 🤯
1. **Shifting mindset** - Shifting my mindset from copy-pasting solutions to understanding when and why a command is relevant to a level.
2. **Getting stuck in** - Forcing myself to get hands-on and try things even without full understanding, instead of waiting for certainty.
3. **New language** - Learning and becoming comfortable with new Linux syntax and command structures.

----------------------------------------------------------

### Takeaways 🥳
1. **Simplicity is key** - Realizing that overcomplicating solutions often wastes time, and starting with simple commands often works best.
2. **Manual** - Using man consistently helped me understand command options and flags, saving trial-and-error attempts. 
3. **Step by step** - Breaking problems into smaller steps made even complex levels approachable and less intimidating.

# Bash scripting 👾
This module was a big step for me when it came to learning how to think like a DevOps engineer. I was pushed to understanding the why behind every action I made.

These are the descriptions for the scripts I wrote for the bash scripting assignment and some key learnings:
### Challenge 1:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers
Calculates addition, subtraction, multiplication for the numbers
Checks if the second number is 0 before dividing (to prevent division by zero)
Prints all results in a single line, with an error message for division if needed

### Challenge 2: 
Creates a directory called bash_demo (if it doesn’t exist)
Creates a text file demo.txt inside it with some content
Displays the content of demo.txt in the terminal

### Challenge 3:
Prompts the user for a filename
Checks if the file exists
Prints a message showing exactly which permissions (read, write, execute) the current user has on that file

#Challenge 4:
Prompts the user to enter a directory to back up
Checks if the directory exists; if not, exits with an error
Creates a backup directory with _backup_<timestamp> appended
Copies all files and subdirectories into the backup
Counts and prints how many files were backed up

## Key learnings 🔑
Working on these Bash scripts gave me hands-on experience automating tasks, handling user input, and managing files and directories efficiently. I gained confidence in writing reliable, structured scripts that can adapt to different situations, and I now appreciate how essential scripting skills are for a DevOps engineer in streamlining workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and maintaining systems effectively.
